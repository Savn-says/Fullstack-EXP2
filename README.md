### What changed:
1. The image paths are updated to reflect the location in the `public` folder. Each image is referenced as `public/image.png`, `public/image-1.png`, `public/image-2.png`, and `public/image-3.png`.

2. Ensure the images are actually pushed to the repository. If they are in the `public` folder, they should be accessible.

Now you can push this `README.md` with the images to your Git repository. Let me know if you need further help!
